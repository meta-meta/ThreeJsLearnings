        <!-- start of lyrics -->
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        I can hear it when they're foolin' around<br>
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        And I hear ev'ry sign, ev'ry sound<br>
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        In the dark with the shades pulled down<br>
        <br>
        Ev'ry word that they say<br>
        Ev'ry noise they make feels it's coming my way<br>
        <br>
        My fav'rite moment<br>
        Putting the glass up next to the wall<br>
        Imagination<br>
        Tho' I see nothing, I hear it all<br>
        Putting my sign up<br>
        Do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out<br>
        Oh mind my clothes, they're all laid out<br>
        <br>
        I can see thru' my windows<br>
        I can see the girls and the boys<br>
        I can see thru' my windows<br>
        And I can imagine the noise<br>
        I can see thru' my windows<br>
        I can see them playing with toys<br>
        <br>
        Oh I hope it won't end<br>
        If I promise not to touch, just be a friend<br>
        <br>
        Life is so lonely<br>
        I don't get high off just being me<br>
        I like pretending<br>
        Wanting to touch them, wanting to see<br>
        It's only normal<br>
        Creeping behind you, now don't shout, 'cos it's alright<br>
        They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight<br>
        <br>
        Oo I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage<br>
        No way in, no way out, and it gets so lonely<br>
        Am I really asking a lot<br>
        Just to reach out and touch somebody<br>
        'Cos when I look thru' my windows or open my door<br>
        I can feel it all around me<br>
        <br>
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        I can hear it when they're foolin' around<br>
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        And I hear ev'ry sight, ev'ry sound<br>
        I can hear thru' these walls<br>
        In the dark with the shades pulled down<br>
        <br>
        Ev'ry word that they say<br>
        Ev'ry noise they make feels it's coming my way<br>
        <br>
        Ah yeah...
